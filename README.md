---

## Demo Data

The app includes 3 sample bookings for demonstration:

- BK001 - Pending status
- BK002 - Approved status
- BK003 - Completed status

---

## Customization

### Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to customize the color scheme:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: { /* ... */ },
      automotive: { /* ... */ }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fonts

Update Google Fonts in `index.html` and `tailwind.config.js`

### Components

All components are reusable and can be customized in the `src/components` directory

---

## Performance

- Optimized bundle size (~100KB gzipped)
